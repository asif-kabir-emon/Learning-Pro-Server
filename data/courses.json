    "details": "Already have some web development experience but interested in making mobile apps? This course is for you. With Expo and React Native, you can build a mobile app using React. It uses the same declarative UI paradigm but renders the same native view components created when writing native code. You can write your app once and run it on multiple platforms, like Android, iOS and even web. By reusing prior web development knowledge you can create mobile apps with native UI and device capabilities. It also speeds up development by reusing most of the same code. But, to get from idea to app on all platforms, basic knowledge of native platforms is required. Expo also provides a range of tools that solves most of the common issues. Although Expo isn’t required to use React Native, it helps developers by removing the need for basic native knowledge. With Expo you can create your apps using pure JavaScript."
